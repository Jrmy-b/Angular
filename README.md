## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* Angular-cli  - You're going to use the Angular cli to manage your front-end build. Make sure you've installed npm / yarn first, then install angular cli globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

or

```bash
$ yarn global add @angular/cli
```
